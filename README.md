## QuotesBookmarker
A single page app to scrape quotes and display them. Helpful for newbies.
Tech Stack: Node.js - React.js &amp; Express.js

To use it locally, you first need to install the npm modules for each folder - the root folder (for the backend) & the clientfiles folder (for the React frontend).

For scraping, it uses the axios and cheerios modules of Node.js, Express to run the surver to respond to the React front-end's GET request.
The scraped quotes are sent as a JSON. To see the response sent: visit: https://powerful-waters-32951.herokuapp.com/api/quotes

The app can be viewed on : https://quotesbookmarker.web.app/
Takes a while to load - about 15-20 seconds. Wanted to keep it as simple as possible.

Backend deployed on Heroku. Front-end on Firebase.

Reach out in case of any issues (I don't think there will be :) )
