# QuotesBookmarker
A single page app to scrape quotes and display them. Tech Stack: Node.js - React.js &amp; Express.js

To use it locally, you first need to install the npm modules for each folder - the root folder (for the backend) & the clientfiles folder (for the React frontend).

For scraping, it uses the axios and cheerios modules of Node.js, Express to run the surver to respond to the React front-end's GET request.
The scraped quotes are sent as a JSON. To see the response sent: visit: https://powerful-waters-32951.herokuapp.com/api/quotes

The app can be viewed on : https://quotesbookmarker.web.app/

I had deployed the backend on Heroku & React frontend on Firebase.

If anyone knows how to properly deploy as a single deploy, please let me know. I've faced numerous issues in that (I used Heroku for that).
I used the fact that React projects after a production build can be served as static files.

Reach out to me for anything!!!
